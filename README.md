## Notes

- The database file is stored in `data/platform.db`
- AI responses depend on OpenAI API availability and quota
- All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Reset tokens expire after 48 hours
- One quiz attempt per student per experiment (enforced)
- AI-generated questions are validated for schema compliance
- Reset tokens are hashed with SHA-256 before storage
- Database operations use transactions for consistency

## Troubleshooting

**Database connection error**: Ensure `data/` directory exists and has write permissions

**AI features not working**: 
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check API key validity and quota at https://platform.openai.com/
- Ensure API key has access to GPT-3.5-turbo model
- Check for rate limiting or quota exceeded errors

**Quiz generation fails**: 
- Ensure experiment has a description (AI uses it for context)
- Check OpenAI API quota and rate limits
- Verify 1-20 questions requested

**Port already in use**:
- Change `PORT` in `.env` for backend
- Modify `vite.config.js` for frontend port

**Password reset not working**:
- Verify email is correct
- Check token hasn't expired (48 hours)
- Ensure password is at least 8 characters

## Future Enhancements

- Email integration for password reset links and invites
- Advanced analytics and learning insights
- Experiment collaboration features
- Mobile app
- Multi-language support
- Certificate generation
- Video transcription using Whisper API
- Leaderboards and gamification
- Experiment difficulty levels
- Custom question types (true/false, fill-in-blank)
- Student groups and class management
